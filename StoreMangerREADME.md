#Documentation
This is an app for store managers. We created this app for a specific store. It can only be accessed by the store managers: Michael, Pam, and Dwight. Once a store manager has successfully signed in, they have access to various inventory tasks including adding, updating, accessing, and deleting inventory data. 


#Things We struggled with

Optimizing our app
 - table for users to store data
 - could have been made for more than a single store
 - store and users would have each had tables 

 for presentation - can use delete product/category to demonstrate back end code
